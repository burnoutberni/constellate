## 2025-02-18 - Dynamic Accessible Labels
**Learning:** Adding dynamic counts to `aria-label` (e.g., "Notifications, 5 unread") significantly improves the screen reader experience for status buttons, as the visual badge is often ignored or read separately.
**Action:** Always check if status indicators (badges, dots) have a corresponding text description in the parent interactive element's accessible name.
